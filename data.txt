The dog ran quickly across the park. The park was full of families playing. The weather was sunny with few clouds. The dog continued running around happily. Many other dogs were also at the park playing joyfully. Everyone at the park was having a nice relaxing afternoon. Some children threw balls for the dogs to fetch. The dogs brought the balls back dutifully each time. It was an idyllic scene in the park that afternoon.
